# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Portfolio

This repository hosts all the projects I've made for fCC's Responsive Web Design certification.

## Content

### Survey Form

A quick survey about technical writing and coding experience. The design is extremely simple with easy to read text.
(It doesn't actually collect any information, as I've left the action attribute blank.)

### Tribute Page

I had two ideas for a tribute page: either PO49 (Quinacridone Gold) watercolor pigment or David Bowie's 1983 Serious Moonlight Tour. Bowie won.

Just a short technical doc about watercolor pigment properties. Has a responsive design that changes based on screen size.

### Product Landing Page

I based this product landing page on the free-to-use vector bee art I found. It's a very simple page for a fictional honey business. Uses flexbox layout and responsive media queries.
