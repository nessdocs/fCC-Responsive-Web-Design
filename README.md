This repository hosts all the projects I've made for fCC's Responsive Web Design certification.

## Content

### Survey Form

A quick survey about technical writing and coding experience. The design is extremely simple with easy to read text.
(It doesn't actually collect any information, as I've left the action attribute blank.)

### Tribute Page

I had two ideas for a tribute page: either PO49 (Quinacridone Gold) watercolor pigment or David Bowie's 1983 Serious Moonlight Tour. Bowie won.
