        <h2>Intro: Finding a Time Machine</h2>
        <p>
          If I had access to a time machine, I'd totally go back to 1983 and try to get a concert ticket to David Bowie's Serious Moonlight tour.
          It's my favorite concert! (Too bad I was born in 1988; I was about 5 + 16~ years too late to actually attend.) 
          Most people seem to gravitate more towards the Ziggy Stardust era, but there's something really special about Serious Moonlight that wows me every time I listen to it.
          The setlist, the emphasis on sax and brass instruments, the costumes, the <i>hair</i>!
          
          Unfortunately, time travel isn't a thing yet, but we do have the next best thing to a time machine: video and audio recordings!
        </p>
        <h3>Video: The HBO Film</h3>
        <p>
          This is probably the first way anyone experiences the Serious Moonlight tour. It's the only official video recording available to consumers, and it's incomplete!
          It's a long concert and they couldn't fit all of it on the VHS tape. Whoever was in charge of making the DVD version didn't put the cut parts back either (or maybe they lost them).
        </p>
        <p>  
          There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/davidbowie/search?query=1983">some bits and pieces of the concert</a> available on Youtube via the official David Bowie channel, but it's mostly just the highlights.
        </p>
        <h3>Audio: Official & Not So Official</h3>
        <p>
          In 2018, we finally got an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Serious-Moonlight-Live-Remastered-Version/dp/B07MBHQYR5">official release</a> of the Serious Moonlight concert on CD. 
          It's basically the audio from the HBO film and is <i>incomplete</i>. The audio has been remastered, but the sound quality is not great.
          It sounds like we're in a tin canâ€”lots of echo and almost like someone's jacked up the treble. Honestly, I've heard better bootleg recordings. Speaking of the elephant in the room...
        </p>
        <p>
          Bootlegs! There's probably one for each day of the concert out there somewhere, and the quality ranges from fantastic to terrible. 
          They're illegal, but they're the closest we have to an actual time machine. <b>For legal purposes I must say that I do not condone bootlegs.</b>
          Prior to 2018, it was really easy to accidentally buy one on Amazon thinking, "Oh, it's a Japan release, maybe they only released it over there!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I go into what makes this concert tour so special, it's helpful to understand some of the historical context .
